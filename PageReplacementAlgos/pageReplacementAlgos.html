              FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
            </h2>
            <p class="simulator-description">
                The First In, First Out (FIFO) algorithm is a common method for 
                handling memory in virtual memory systems. It functions like a 
                waiting line for memory pages. When a program needs a page not 
                currently in memory (page fault), the oldest page 
                (at the front of the line) is evicted to make space for the 
                new one. This ensures fairness but can lead to more page 
                faults with some workloads, as recently used pages might be 
                swapped out too early. FIFO is a simple and easy-to-understand 
                algorithm that works well for programs that tend to use 
                recently accessed pages again soon.

              Optimal
            </h2>
            <p class="simulator-description">
                The optimal page replacement algorithm (OPT) boasts the ideal 
                scenario for minimizing page faults in memory management. 
                Unlike real-world algorithms, OPT has the magical ability to 
                predict future page access. When a page fault occurs, OPT 
                kicks in by evicting the page that won't be used for the longest 
                time in the future. This minimizes page faults but is purely 
                theoretical. Since predicting the future is impossible for an 
                operating system, OPT serves as a benchmark to compare the 
                effectiveness of other, more practical page replacement 
                algorithms like FIFO and LRU.

                LRU (Least-Recently-Used)
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm aims to 
                keep frequently accessed pages in memory for faster processing. 
                It operates under the assumption that pages used recently are 
                more likely to be needed again soon. Unlike FIFO's queue system, 
                LRU tracks which pages are used and prioritizes keeping them around. 
                When a page fault happens and a new page needs space, LRU evicts the 
                least recently used page, freeing room for the new arrival. This 
                strategy helps reduce page faults by keeping frequently used pages 
                within reach and is a popular choice in operating systems due to its 
                effectiveness in minimizing data swapping between memory and storage.

                MRU (Most-Recently-Used)
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The Most Recently Used (MRU) page replacement algorithm, 
                though seemingly intuitive, has a major drawback that limits 
                its use in operating systems. MRU focuses on protecting the most 
                recently used page. When a new page triggers a page fault, 
                MRU evicts the page that was just accessed 
                to make space. This might seem logical, but Belady's anomaly exposes 
                a surprising issue. In certain scenarios, increasing available memory 
                can actually lead to more page faults with MRU. This is because the 
                recently used page MRU protects might not be the one needed again soon, 
                potentially causing unnecessary eviction of frequently used pages. 
                While MRU is simple, it is impractical for 
                real-world memory management, where efficiency is crucial.

                Belady's Anomaly
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                Belady's anomaly is a surprising phenomenon in computer memory management. 
                It occurs when using certain page replacement algorithms, like First-In-First-Out 
                (FIFO). In these algorithms, increasing the amount of available memory in main 
                memory (adding more page frames) can actually lead to more page faults, not less. 
                This is counterintuitive because more memory should allow the system to hold onto 
                frequently used pages, reducing the need to fetch them from slower storage. 
                Belady's anomaly highlights the importance of choosing the right page 
                replacement algorithm, as some perform better than others under different 
                memory access patterns.

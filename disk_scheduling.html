              SSTF(Shortest Seek Time First)
            </h2>
            <p class="simulator-description">
                The SSTF disk scheduling algorithm minimizes 
                seek time by servicing the request closest to the current position of the 
                disk arm first. It calculates the seek time for each request by measuring 
                the distance between the current position and the requested track. The 
                request with the shortest seek time is then selected and serviced next. 
                This approach aims to reduce the overall time spent moving the disk arm, 
                potentially improving disk performance. However, it may lead to starvation 
                of requests located farther away from the current position

              FCFS(First Come First Serve)
            </h2>
            <p class="simulator-description">
                The FCFS disk scheduling algorithm services disk requests in the order they
                 arrive, without considering the distance between requests or the current 
                 position of the disk arm. Requests are serviced sequentially from the 
                 beginning of the queue to the end. While simple to implement, FCFS may result
                 in longer seek times, especially if there are requests scattered across the disk. 
                 This can lead to inefficient disk utilization and poor overall performance.

                SCAN 
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The SCAN disk scheduling algorithm services requests by moving the disk arm 
                in one direction (e.g., towards the outermost or innermost track) until it 
                reaches the end of the disk, then reverses direction. Requests are serviced 
                in the order they are encountered while scanning back and forth. SCAN minimizes 
                seek time by serving requests efficiently along the path of the disk arm, 
                reducing unnecessary movement compared to FCFS. However, it can lead to longer 
                wait times for requests located at the extremes of the disk if there is 
                continuous high disk activity.

                C-SCAN 
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The C-SCAN (Circular SCAN) disk scheduling algorithm is similar to SCAN but 
                differs in how it handles the end of the disk. Instead of reversing direction 
                at the end, C-SCAN wraps around to the beginning of the disk, forming a circular 
                path. This prevents excessive waiting times for requests near the end of the 
                disk, as they are promptly serviced when the disk arm returns to the beginning. 
                C-SCAN is particularly useful for systems with high disk activity, as it 
                ensures more equitable servicing of requests across the disk surface compared 
                to SCAN.

                LOOK 
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The LOOK disk scheduling algorithm is similar to SCAN but differs in its handling 
                of requests at the end of the disk. Instead of moving the disk arm to the end of 
                the disk and reversing direction, LOOK stops at the last request in the current 
                direction and then reverses direction. This prevents unnecessary movement to the 
                end of the disk and back, reducing seek time. LOOK serves requests along the path 
                of the disk arm without scanning beyond the last request in each direction, 
                resulting in potentially improved performance compared to SCAN.

                C-LOOK 
              </h2>
              <p class="simulator-description">
                The C-LOOK (Circular LOOK) disk scheduling algorithm is an improvement over LOOK, 
                focusing on reducing seek time by eliminating unnecessary movement at the ends 
                of the disk. Similar to C-SCAN, C-LOOK wraps around to the beginning of the disk 
                after servicing requests in one direction, forming a circular path. It services 
                requests only up to the last request in each direction, avoiding unnecessary 
                scanning to the end of the disk. C-LOOK aims to provide more efficient disk 
                utilization and reduced seek time compared to LOOK, particularly in scenarios 
                with high disk activity and varying seek distances.
